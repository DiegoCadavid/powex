> [!WARNING]  
> the development of this framework is in a very early version, not recommended for use in a production environment.

## Create a Powex Project

Clone [Powex Boilerplate](https://github.com/DiegoCadavid/powex-boilerplate) and create your extension in seconds! using powex + typescript + tailwind. 

--------

## Getting Started Development

These instructions will give you a copy of the project up and running on
your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Requirements for the software and other tools to build, test and push

- Node.js


### install dependencies
```
$ npm install
```

### Install Powex package on local
```
$ npm run build:dev
```
this command will compile the javascript code and install powex globally so you can use it in any project using `npx powex build`

> [!NOTE]  
> Keep in mind that it is the first framework that I developed! for now I do not recommend its use in production, also it is in a very early stage so it lacks some development tools.
